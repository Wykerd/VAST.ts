# Prequisites

This library is written in TypeScript and is intended to be used in a Node.js environment. It is recommended to have a basic understanding of TypeScript and Node.js before using this library.

Additionally, this library uses modern ECMAScript features and has no intention on supporting legacy Node versions. Therefore, the library is only tested on Node 18 and above (ES2022, specifically private class fields).
